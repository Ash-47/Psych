          Extraversion (or extroversion) is characterized by excitability, sociability, talkativeness,
          assertiveness, and high amounts of emotional expressiveness. People who are high in extraversion
          are outgoing and tend to gain energy in social situations. Being around other people helps them
          feel energized and excited.
        </p>
        <p>
          People who are low in extraversion (or introverted) tend to be more reserved and have less energy to
          expend in social settings. Social events can feel draining and introverts often require a period of
          solitude and quiet in order to "recharge."
